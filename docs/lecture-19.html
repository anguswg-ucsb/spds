## Multiply cell-wise

- algebraic, logical, and functional operations act on a raster cell-wise


---

# Reclassify

---



---

# Object/Raster Interaction

- Objects can be used to extract values from a raster!

--

- Lets get some objects from OpenStreetMap

--

- OSM provides the largest, most up to date digital representation of the earths features

--

- Learning to identify and extract OSM data will provide you with more data to anwser questions then you weill ever need!

--

- Lets say we want the river channels in the Goleta Area...

---

# OpenStreetMap (OSM) tags

- A OSM tag consists of two items:
  
  - a "key" and a "value." 

--

  - Tags describe _specific_ features of map elements (*nodes*, _ways_, or _relations_). 

--

  - Tags are presented "for humans" as key=value: separated by an equals sign. 

--

- The **key** is used to describe a topic, category, or type of feature (e.g., highway or name). 

--

- Keys can be qualified with prefixes, infixes, or suffixes (usually, separated with a colon, :), forming super- or sub-categories 

--

- The _value_ provides detail about a _key-specified_ feature. Commonly, values are: 
  - free form text: name="Hollistor Road"
  - one of a set of distinct values: highway=motorway, 
  - multiple values (separated by a semicolon) (e.g. motorcycle:rental=yes)
 
--

- So for a *river*, if we [google OSM river](https://www.google.com/search?q=osm+rivers) ...
  
---
  

---

# Lets get the waterway data in R!

- OSM has global coverage, we need to limit the results to Goleta

--

- Goltea is our 'AOI', and can be defined by its bbox or extent.

--

- Since OSM is global, all data is in the WGS84 Geographic CRS (`EPSG:4326`)

--



---

With a bounding box, we can use the `osmdata` library to format OSM (overpass API) queries:



---
### But... we want features!

--

Specifically features that match the tag `waterway=stream`

--


---

With a formatted query, we can extract the web-based data as `sf` objects

--


  
---

### So what did we get?


---

## Lets find the longest river segment *IN* our extent



--



---

# Value Extraction

- Often, we want to know the profile and sinousity of a river

- To do this, we need to know the inlet and outlet as well as the straight line connector



---


---
## Sinuosity

Channel **sinuosity** is calculated by dividing the length of the stream channel by the straight line distance between the end points of the selected channel reach.




---

## River Slope:

The change in elevation between the inlet/outlet divided by the length (rise/run) give us the slope of the river:

--

To calculate this, we must extract elevation values at the inlet and outlet:

--



--



---

## River profile

What does the elevation profile of the river look like?

# Map Algebra
---

# Map Algebra

- Dana Tomlin (Tomlin 1990) defined a framework for the analyizing field data stored as grided values.

--

- He called this framework map algebra. 

--

- Map algebra operations and functions are broken down into four types: 

--

  - local

--

  - focal

--

  - zonal 

--

  - global

---

# Yesterdays Rainfall data:



---

# Local

- Local operations and functions are applied to **each** individual cell and only involve those cells sharing the same location.

--

- More than one raster can be involved in a local operation. 

--

- For example, rasters can be **summed** ( each overlapping pixels is added) 

--

- Local operations also include **reclassification** of values. 

---



---

# Focal

- Also referred to as "neighborhood" operations.

--

- Assigns summary values to the output cells based on the neighboring cells in the input raster. 

--

- For example, a cell output value can be the average of 9 neighboring input cells (including the center cell) - this acts as a smoothing function.

---

# Focal

- Focal operations require a window (also known as a kernel) to work over

--

- Additionally a kernel also defines the weight each neighboring cell contributes to the summary statistic. 

--

- For example, all cells in a 3x3 neighbor could each contribute 1/9th of their value to the summarized value (i.e. equal weight). 

- The weight can take on a more complex form defined by a function; such weights are defined by a kernel function. 

- One popular function is a Gaussian weighted function which assigns greater weight to nearby cells than those further away ([Toblers first law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobler%27s_first_law_of_geography))

---

# Example: Focal

Lets apply a smoothing kernel to our UCSB elevation data over an 11x11 window, using the mean operator

## What did we do?

---

# Zonal 

- Zonal operations compute a summary values (such as the mean) from cells aggregated to some zonal unit. 

--

- Like focal operations, a zone and a mediating function must be defined

--

- The most basis example of a zonal function is aggregation!

--



---

# Zonal Statisics (More advanced)

- For more complicated object zones, [exactextractr](https://github.com/isciences/exactextractr) is a fast and effiecient R utility that binds the C++ `exactextract` tool. 

--

- What is the county level mean January rainfall in California?

--



---

# What about the US?






---

# Global

- Global operations make use of _some_ or _all_ input cells when computing an output cell value. 

- They are a special case of zonal operations with the _entire_ raster represents a single zone. 

- Examples include generating descriptive statistics for the entire raster dataset

### Mean Monthly Rainfall for California



---

### One potential limit to the raster package in R is speed

- If dealing with bigger data, the raster package is a bit antiquated

--

- rasterize polygons: `fasterize`

- Extract cell values by feature: `velox`

- Zonal Statistics: `exactextractr`

- Proxy objects: `stars`

--

- If you really want to work with _BIG_ data (e.g. Terabytes or Petabytes) your limit is both hardware and software...

--

- Cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine are valuable

- GEE is a javascript library with some python bindings build by Google, but as with most great spatial libraries it has an R [wrapper](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee):

All said, there are many valid reason to **not** use R, but speed is not one of them even though is is commonly the most cited...

# Extra! Animating Rasters...

Install and load the `gifski` package

- **save_gif**: combines many individual plots

- A **for loop** build the plots

- The **plot** is what we have been doing all along (if you want a ggplot you must print the object!)

- **gif_file**: the path to save the image

- **width/height**: the image dimensions

- **delay**: the pause between frames

- **loop**: should the gif play over and over?

# Result

# Daily Assignment:

Keep working in your elevation Rmd...

- install `osmdata` from CRAN

- For the Goleta area, extract all OSM point data for restaurants. See [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity%3Drestaurant) for the OSM tag.

- Keep only those that have a name in the name attribute (remove NAs)

- `extract` the elevation of these restaurants from your elevation raster
  - add this information as a new column to the OSM points 

- Create a leaflet map to show these locations as `Markers`.
  - The `label` should be the name
  - The `popup` should be the elevation cast to a character.
